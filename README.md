# South Park Guessing Game

## Technologies: React.js, JSX, and Materialize CSS

### Description

This project was built first using Javascript, but later converted using React.js framework.  Building a simple guessing game between the numbers of 1-10,000.  This project helped increase my knowledge of React.js and the use of updateing and saving state.  I also implemented the use of local storage to save users lowest score even when the application is closed and played at a later time.
